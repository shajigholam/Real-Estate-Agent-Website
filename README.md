# Real Estate Agent Website
This project involves creating a professional website for a local real estate agent. The site consists of:

Home Page: Showcases the agent's profile, mission statement, customer feedback, and a video highlighting previous property listings.

Property Listing Pages: Three separate pages with detailed information, including price, address, rooms, and images, for current property listings.

Available Properties Page: Displays thumbnail images and brief descriptions of all available properties, linking to detailed listings.

Contact Form Page: Includes a form for visitors to express property preferences, with validation and a confirmation alert.

Site Map and Credits Page: Lists website links and credits sources for graphics and property information.

CSS and JavaScript are organized in separate files, and all resources are credited. The goal is to create an inviting online presence for the agent.

In order to make the real estate agent's website accessible via a public URL, I implemented a static hosting solution. The chosen hosting service for this project is Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), a reputable and free hosting platform.
